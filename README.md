Used AI to assist with frontend integration as needed.
Working off localhost, so mobile integration is there on papaer but untested sadly :(
Current known issues (as of 8-4-25): 
-The background doesn't always line up with the bottom like it's supposed to when adding new elements. 
 -Unsure how to fix this currently.
