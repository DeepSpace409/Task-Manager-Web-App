Used AI to assist with frontend integration as needed.
Working off localhost, so mobile integration is there on papaer but untested sadly :(
Current known issues (as of 8-4-25): 
-The background doesn't always line up with the bottom like it's supposed to when adding new elements. 
 -Unsure how to fix this currently.
-Page Icon doesn't appear on some browsers
How to use:
-in terminal (bash or vscode inbuilt)
 -use npx prisma generate
 -npm run dev
-view localhost:3000
